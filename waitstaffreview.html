        <h2>The Brief：</h2>
        <p> “While there are many ways to rate and review restaurants, these are not focused on evaluating individuals servers. Design an experience where diners can submit positive comments and constructive suggestions for the wait staff, and servers can use this feedback to both improve and help to secure new employment. Provide a high-level flow and supporting wireframes.”</p>

					<div class="jiange"></div>					
					<p class="myh2">Customer expectations have changed, businesses are now competing for better service.</p>
					<p class="myh3">Why they need customer service review?</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>Negative customer service experiences can hurt a business.</li>
					  <li>The bad customer service reaches more than twice as many ears as praise on the excellent service experience.</li>
					  <li>It takes 12 positive experiences to make up for one unresolved negative experience.</li>
					  <li>86% of customers will pay more for better customer experience.</li>
					  <li>Perfecting the customer experience can do wonders for business.</li>					  
					</ul>

					<div class="jiange"></div>
					
					<p class="myh2">Why is hard to collect customers reviews?</p>
					<p class="myh3">The platform:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>It’s hard to collect Feedback from Every Touchpoint, according to Google, 98% of Americans switch between some devices daily. As the number of interactions between you and your customers becomes more diverse, it’s become increasingly crucial to gain insight into every touchpoint involved. </li>				  
					</ul>
					
					<p class="myh3">The customer: </p>
					<ul>
					  <li>little incentive for diners to rate their wait staff experience unless it’s either extremely positive or negative, if the service as expected, they would come back as long as the food is good. </li>	
                      <li>If the customers are not satisfied, 13% of them will tell to 15 or even more people that they are unhappy. On the other hand, 72% of customers will share a positive experience with 6 or more people. 67% of customers mention bad experiences as a reason for churn, but only 1 out of 26 unhappy customers complain. The rest, they just leave.</li>
					  </ul>

					<div class="jiange"></div>					

					<p class="myh2">What happened when the data gathered today? </p>
                     <p class="changgui">Too many companies squander the treasure that is customer feedback. The solution is systematically measuring the customer’s voice and integrating it into a culture of continuous feedback.</p>

		Based on the research, people don't like to download the extra app for the restaurant searching and reviews, I decided design combine with the existing apps. People use the digital app for searching restaurant and making reservations. However, few of them will go back to the restaurant page after the dinner, how to find the right time let them leave a review?
		</p>
		
        <p>
		Writing reviews is a very subjective thing, based on the user interview, people prefer to see the professional reviews before they go to the restaurant, they like read notes from KOLs. (Key opinion leaders).

 <img src="images/myimg/waitstaffreview/10.png">
 <p>After analyzing different review methods, I realize that different method have the different preference. The review page should include several review methods to meet the needs of given positive comments and construction suggestions. I decided to use five-star rating with tags and comments to let people submit their review.</p>

        <h2>USER TEST</h2>
          <p>To understand the user behavior and their thoughts. I asked diners to complete two tasks:
1. Write the review for the restaurant
2. Write the review for the server
Once they noticed the server review step, I gave them a "hint" that Simon was their server.</p>	

<p>Due to the time limitation, I ask the Uber driver's feedback about the review system; he said: "It's easy to give a low rate, but at least they should tell me why. I really appreciate if they can tell more details about the performance. otherwise, I do not accept the low rates."</P>

<h2>Key Learnings:</h2>
<p>People like use tags to submit the reviews, they don't want to write extra words. However, if the service is not good, they will write lots of explanation for the bad service.</p>

				<p class="changgui">Learn from Zomato, The business owner will hold meet-up for the key opinion leaders. For the owners side, I choose Google my business platform to integrate. It's pretty straightforward, because Google My Business dashboard already offers the functionality required to manage employees and reviews.</p>	
				<p class="changgui">Owners can get more control for their wait staffs. Separate the service score and restaurant score, they can make marketing strategy in a better way.</p>

		<p class="myh3">1. Online - Social media</p>
          <p>Based on my observation, I noticed lot of people really enjoy the game, after they finished game and unlocked the badges, parts of them noticed the local guide features in the Google maps, which means it enlarge the local guide community. For this scenario, the strategy could be show the new badges on the social media and expand the review awareness. It can let more people know their contribution is important to the servers, they will have more empathy and motivation to write the review for the servers.</p>	

<p class="myh3">2. Offline - Meetups</p>
<p>Let the restaurant owners organize some meetups for the diner communities by choosing some local guides. Owners can hear more feedback from the diners; the diner will have more motivation to submit the review, leave a positive comment and construction suggestions.</p>

				<p class="changgui">After finishing this project, I had the chance to take a look back to this project. I believe there is still a chance to continue to optimize this project in the future. </p>	

				
				<p class="changgui"><span>Conduct field research, learn more about the server and owner.</span> The market of review system is large; it is important to provide customized solutions for different need.</p>
				
				<p class="changgui"><span>Test with different stakeholders.</span> Due to the time limitation; I only do the usability test on the diner side, it gives me positive feedback and some suggestions. Rapid iteration is one way for the improvement.</p>
				
				<p class="changgui"><span>Explore more about different parts from different levels of users.</span> Combine with the service blueprint, think more details based on each touch point. like how to set the filter in the review system. How to train the server who does not have any work experiences. </p>
